			<p>Bards of the College of Linguistics are expert translators, elocutionists, and cryptographers. In their bardic studies, they research not only how they can most effectively inspire their friends with their spoken and written word, but also how they can best manipulate the utterances and resonances of their spells to maximize their impact. Despite their profound magical abilities, these bards prefer learning to communicate with other creatures “the old-fashioned way,” as they find it to be the most authentic and precise way to express themselves. They dive headlong into the history and culture surrounding a  language—excitedly noting the idiosyncrasies of each dialect—and they dream of opportunities where they can properly show off their fluency to native speakers</p>

			<p><em>14rd-level College of Linguistics feature</em></p>
			<p>At 14th level, through your esoteric studies of language, you have unveiled a series of forgotten, forbidden, or destructive words that can magically cripple the linguistic capabilities of your foes. As an action, you can utter your words of power and choose one creature within 120 feet of you that can hear you. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. <br/> On a failed save, the target takes psychic or thunder damage (your choice) equal to 2d10 + half your bard level, and for I minute or until you lose your concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), the target can’t speak, com-municate telepathically, perform the verbal componentsof spells, or understand language. On a suc-cessful save, the target takes half as much damage and stumbles over its words for a short time; all creatures have advantage on saving throws made against any spells the target casts before the end of its next turn. <br/> Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finishashortor long rest.</p>

			<p><em>3rd-level College of Linguistics feature</em></p>
			<p>3rd level, you learn to enhance the potency of the magical words you speak. The range of your Bardic Inspiration feature increases to 120 feet. <br/> In addition, whenever you cast a spell that has a verbal component, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to either grant one friendly target of the spell temporary hit points or cause one hostile target of the spell to take psychic or thunder damage (your choice). The amount of temporary hit points gained or damage dealt is equal to the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. When you expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration in this way, you can also apply one of the following Vocal Projections of your choice to the spell. You can use only one Vocal Projection option per turn.
				<p><b>Manipulative Projection.</b> You interweave the verbal components of the spell with a mind-altering enchant-ment, influencing the actions of one creature affected by the spell. If the target is friendly, it has advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn; if the target is hostile, it has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. </p>
				<p><b>Thunderous Projection.</b> Your voice booms as you perform the verbal components of the spell. If the spell has a range of 5 feet or greater, its range is doubled for this casting.</p>
				<p><b>Ventriloquist’s Projection.</b> You perform the verbal components of the spell through a willing creature you can see within 60 feet of you, speaking through the creature in your own voice. If the spell has a range of touch, that creature can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell (no action required), otherwise the spell originates from you.</p>
