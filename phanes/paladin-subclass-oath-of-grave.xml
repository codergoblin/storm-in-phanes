    <description>
      <p>Diaprats of the order of the “grave knights” swear the oath to serve in their life and beyond the grave. They sacrifice their chance at the afterlife for an immortality of servitude for the greater good. In life a grave knight is expected to be a beacon of virtue, uncorruptible and worthy of wielding the great power and temptation that comes with undeath. Only few initiatiated become true undead or “catacomb saint” as to maintan the sense of self requires great amount willpower and dedication to the cause.</p>
      <p><i>Et in morte servio</i></p>
      <h5>Tenants of the grave knights</h5>
      <p>Through the teachings of the grave knights, the diaprats of the order share theese virtues:</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Asceticism</i></b> A grave knight must practice selflesness, complete absinence in material goods and worldly pleasures. Only through a rigid spiritual practice a grave knight may preserve the consciousness and sense of self into the undeath. </p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Self sacrifice</i></b> A grave knight must not be afraid to give up its possessions, sustain wounds or be humiliated to protect those in need and fulfil its duties. </p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Chivalry</i></b> A grave knight must hold itself to a high moral compass, be an example to the people and a pillar of the community. In undeadth a catacomb saint is not feared, but reveared for his deeds in life. </p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Mortality</i></b>  A grave knight walks a path of death and ponders mortality and frailty of existence. Grave knights will participate in frays, wars, disasters and epidemies close to the avant-garde where they can help the most and get accustomed with the concept of death.</p>
